$_SESSION['authorized'] = TRUE;
...and on other pages just check if user is authorized:

if (isset($_SESSION['authorized']) && $_SESSION['authorized'] === TRUE) {
    // Alright, let's show all the hidden functionality!
    echo "Psst! Hey! Wanna buy some weed?";
} else {
    // User is not authorized!
    header('Location: login.php');
    exit();
}
